// Wrappers around third-party ssimulacra2 implementations.
// Each takes two RGBA8 buffers and returns a double score, matching the
// signature of ic_ssimulacra2_score in ic_metrics.h.
//
// Declarations are unconditional. CMake decides at build time which impl_*.cpp
// files to compile and link against. compare.cpp gates calls with HAVE_*.
